  * Protect the time reset logic from a race condition.
    Fixes #341 <https://github.com/ros/geometry2/issues/341>
    This could incorrectly trigger a buffer clear if two concurrent callbacks were invoked.

  * fix(buffer-client): Use actionlib api for obtaining result
    Use the API provided by actionlib for waiting for result. This will improve the response time and prevent problems with custom solutions (see #178 <https://github.com/ros/geometry2/issues/178>). This change makes constructor parameter check_frequency obsolute and deprecates it.
  * Add check to buffer_client.py to make sure result is available
    Related issue: #178 <https://github.com/ros/geometry2/issues/178>
  * Add check to reset buffer when rostime goes backwards
  * Fixed the value of expected_success_count_

ros-lunar-tf2-ros (0.5.12-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * remove annoying gcc warning
    This is because the roslog macro cannot have two arguments that are
    formatting strings: we need to concatenate them first.
  * break canTransform loop only for non-tiny negative time deltas
    (At least) with Python 2 ros.Time.now() is not necessarily monotonic
    and one can experience negative time deltas (usually well below 1s)
    on real hardware under full load. This check was originally introduced
    to allow for backjumps with rosbag replays, and only there it makes sense.
    So we'll add a small duration threshold to ignore backjumps due to
    non-monotonic clocks.

ros-lunar-tf2-ros (0.5.11-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * do not short circuit waitForTransform timeout when running inside pytf. Fixes #102 <https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/102>
    roscpp is not initialized inside pytf which means that ros::ok is not
    valid. This was causing the timer to abort immediately.
    This breaks support for pytf with respect to early breaking out of a loop re #26 <https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/26>.
    This is conceptually broken in pytf, and is fixed in tf2_ros python implementation.
    If you want this behavior I recommend switching to the tf2 python bindings.
